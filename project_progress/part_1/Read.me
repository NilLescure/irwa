0: Prerrequisites:
  - Acces to the internet and collab ( Google ).
1: How to run the code
  - Download the ProjectPart1 notebook and the dataset. For good practices reasons, this dataset is not included in this repository so you MUST have access to Aula global 
    or have it downloaded.
  - Option 1: Google Collab:
    - Upload the both files to google drive and open the notebook
    - Change our hardcoded path in the variable declaration of docs_path for the one in you drive
    - Run the cells and enjoy
  - Option 2: Local storage
    - In case you want to have the project in local storage you can also replace the docs_path for the one in you pc
    - This of course assumes that you have installed some notebook interpreter like anaconda jupiter 
    - You might also have to download your missing libraries with pip install -x
    - Run the cells and enjoy

2: Structure of the code overview
  - This will be better explained in the report so we highly encourage its reading
  - Part 1: Data preprocessing
    - In this part we will be making use of the basic python libraries used in datascience to transform our data for later explotation.
  - Part 2: Exploratory data analisis 
    - In this part we will be showing some analitycs and visualisation that are requested and some that helped us understand the data better.
